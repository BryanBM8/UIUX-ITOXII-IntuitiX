EasyWell is an innovative UI/UX work that we designed for a mobile application with a health theme. Our health theme focuses on health and physical fitness, especially maintaining a balanced body pattern by doing regular exercise and diet. EasyWell was designed as our participation in the ITOXII competition organized by Politeknik Caltex Riau. With our design, we wanted to create an idea that embodies a variety of sports application features in one application. Our features focus on providing trainer services and diet foods, calorie tracks, and exercise tutorials. With the variety of features, we hope that users will find it easier to use the app.
